            <h1>Simple Parallax Scrolling Page</h1>
                <p>Parallax scrolling is a web site trend where the background content (i.e. an image) is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling..<br>Parallax scrolling does not always work on mobile devices/smart phones. However, you can use media queries to turn off the effect on mobile devices.</br>Parallax scrolling is a scrolling technique used in computer graphics in which background images move more slowly than images in the foreground, creating the illusion of depth and immersion. It is often used in video games.In the world of digital graphics, programmers can achieve parallax scrolling in different ways. One involves creating different layers that move at uneven speeds when rendered in a browser or other viewer. Alternately, programmers can create "sprites," or independent parts of an image, often in the form of avatars or characters that move within a digital landscape. The cycling of repeating patterns is another technique that has been useful in many video game projects and other animations, and programmers can also manipulate the rendering of raster graphics or bitmapped visuals to create parallax scrolling.In general, developers have to consider various elements to create a parallax scrolling effect with integrity and versatility. For example, one approach involves the creation of image layers through attribution, followed by assigning a scroll function and designating speeds for each item, then adding any HTML or CSS fixes for different browsers or viewers. As with other kinds of visual projects, incorporating the right syntax of the latest versions of these resources are crucial to developing a parallax scrolling technique that works well.</p>
